# PictureWorld
Project for Dynamic Web Systems course at Lule√• University of Technology

PictureWorld is a web application for picture uploading and management using geolocation. 
There are a lot of web pages that allow the user to upload photos and save them in their accounts, the big difference between other web pages and PictureWorld is that PictureWorld makes all this process very visual and easy.

The most important point of the web page is the map where your pictures are showed, and where you can see photos taken by people from all over the world. So we can say that PictureWorld is a social network that allows you to upload your geolocated photos and show them to all the world, at the same time that you can explore the planet watching the photos that other user have uploaded.

See the table below for a complete list of all user possibilities that allows PictureWorld:
